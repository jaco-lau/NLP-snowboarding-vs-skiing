133,"Maybe smth like a hybrid camber with not too much camber with a medium-soft flex would be good for you (that was my first board hehe). It also really depends on where you are in terms of progression at the moment. When I bought my first board I knew I wanted to focus on freestyle so this type of board is good to use for growing into intermediate at park (but not every board with this profile is, mine specifically is also a twin so that I could ride switch with ease and you need to take other specs into account). However it is also a good board type to practice for beginners, even though it would get some getting used to for sure. I first learned on a stiff rental board and I found turn initiation much easier on a softer hybrid camber profile. It took me time to get used to handling bumps and uneven terrain on the hybrid camber (harder) but I felt it was easier to maneuver too. From my personal experience, I grew out of the rental board pretty quickly and was very satisfied to use the board I bought. It also depends on your experience in board sports I think.

350,"Just try to take it slower. Go back to basics and practice your J turns on those open, steep slopes. So point it, turn on either edge, and head almost completely upwards on the slope, stop, then start again but use the other edge. Some really good advice I got for pointing it on steeps is to ""growl"" at the slope before going.

Depending on the mountain, you've got to do a lot of rope/snow fence work, traverses, etc. and it's just much easier to be mobile on skis.

540,"Pretzels are kind of a hard trick to explain with words. Think about over the course of the trick from lip to landing you do what aggregates to a frontside 180. Both on jumps and out of rails Spins are initiated with hips and shoulders, and we have some amount of control with how quickly we pull our legs along into the rotation.

To me it looks like you’re not really initiating rotation off of the lip as you jump into your front board, and trying to come up with the spin at the end. When I do front board pretzels I start by riding into the rail with my hips and shoulders “pre- oriented”backside. Then I move my hips in sort of a fs 180 motion as I pop off of the lip of the takeoff, while I lock onto the rail in an independent and opposite motion with my feet. Basically I jump into and lock in to my front board under my front foot, then I pivot my hips and shoulder in a frontside rotation while on the rail. This means that when I pop off the end of the rail my hips and shoulders are oriented and pushing in a direction to initiate the frontside spin out. And then you do still have to kind of reach that back foot around in front. This is a trick you kind of have to lean into with your leading hip and shoulder.

If you look at your own body in the clip, on the spin out you are fighting against your shoulders which don’t really have rotation of their own.

613,"Looking for a new board after having the same one for 20 years, need advice. I've had a rigid, apparently short (like 158?), directional board for the entire time I've been snowboarding. Somehow I managed to learn on it. I realized I had outgrown it when I had to put my bindings on the very last holes at each side. This makes the tips kind of short on the outsides of the bindings; the board being directional, it is shorter on one tip than the other.

I am 6'3""(191cm), 190 lbs(86kg) and recently became more interested in tricks and more motivated to learn them as I now live closer to a resort so I wanted to make sure I could get a board that I could practice butters on but also hit some jumps probably. Not that worried about grinds/rails. There is no powder at this resort, like... ever. Given Ohio's climate, there's more ice than powder. But I still do want to be able to go down piste stably.

I've been looking at the Solomon assassin and the Jones mountain twin as those are a couple of boards that go up to the sizes that I need. I would love a Capita DOA but it doesn't seem like they make them long enough for me. I'll need a wide board that's at least 260 mm across as I have a US size 12 foot. given my wide stance I'm figuring on at least 163 length leaning towards 165.

632,"I need a new snowboard (preferably powder board) and would like advice! Here's my info:

Female, 5'1"", 135lbs. (Mostly muscle, I am quite fit)
Expert-level rider who loves riding powder/off-piste, weaving through right trees, and getting air off cliff drops and side hits.
I charge hard and ride very aggressively and pretty fast.
I like to ride switch but don't do it too often in the trees, and want a directional board.
I also love to ride park, but my current board should hold up as a park board for another season or two.

My current board is a 2012 Bataleon Distortia 143. I love it, but I definitely want a board for powder that floats a lot better. PS this is basically my only board ever besides the K2 I learned on.

I work at Monarch Mountain in Colorado, and as an employee I get a discount with Weston and Never Summer, not sure about other brands.
With that in mind, I've mostly been looking at the Weston Eclipse (solid not split) 145, Never Summer Lady West 144, and Never Summer Harpoon 144.
I'm also open to other brands (like Jones or Bataleon), but I'd like to spend under $400 so it depends if I can get a discount.

Mainly I want a board that floats in powder and feels kinda surfy (I am a surfer also), has good maneuverability in tight trees, is semi-stiff but has some flex, has good edge hold and can survive groomers, and charges hard.

Has anyone ridden any of those boards I mentioned? Or have other suggestions/reviews?

672,"If you can go get fitted by a ski shop bootfitter. Your boots are crucial to your enjoyment.  Too loose or too tight you will have a bad time. I would say boots are one of the pieces of gear (if you can) to buy new for this reason. That said you can find good used boots but if you’re not experienced with fit it is hit or miss. 

Helmet- get whatever is comfortable. Lots of used gear places sell them and new for cheap. 

Goggles- depends where you’re riding but you can pick up a pair of cheaper everyday lense goggles. If you plan on doing this sport for a long time it would be worth it to get a goggle that has interchangeable lenses that you can go back over time and pick up more lenses for the various sun /cloudy/stormy conditions you may encounter. Zionor, smith, even blenders are good places to check out. Zionor and blenders tend to be on the cheaper side of smith. 

Pants and jacket - nothing wrong with starting with used gear here. You want at least 10k waterproofing. Gore-tex is the high end waterproof and wind proofing but last a long time. Ideally as a new snowboarder you will want a longer coat that goes over your butt or some extremely waterproof pants. You will spend a decent amount of time on your butt while learning. This means wet/cold butt as snow freezes on your pants.

908,"You've got the idea for sure, you mostly just need more time on your board to build that muscle memory so you can do the things you're doing more dynamically, with more power, and speed.

A couple tips to keep in mind:

Try pointing the direction you want to turn with your front arm, that will help you to be more dynamic in your turn initiation. 

You have your knees bent, great!  Now you want to be more dynamic again, popping up just a little to initiate the turn, then coming back down to finish it.  This will help you unweight and reweight your board for easier and less sketch turns.

Try going a little faster, moving so slowly isn't making things easier.  Going faster will let you use more toe and heel pressure from which you can move with more power.

Honestly most beginners are worse than you, but you were still bending at the waist too much, your shoulders should more or less be over your board for beginner turns.

You are linking turns, that's great; learning accelerates from here.  Get more time on the board and concentrate on moving with more conviction and power and you'll be shredding in no time.

1001,"Don’t get me wrong, the bent chetlers are not a bad ski. But having ridden the old automatics, which are the bent chetler 100s, for a day. And the regular width one for a few runs. It’s just that there are many other skis brands like volkl mantra, blizzard bonafide, kastle, fischer rangers, nordica enforcers or head kore that has their racing ski tech with them that cater better towards ski racers and the a like. The bents just don’t have that backbone, especially in sometimes rough resort conditions. The bent chetlers were designed primarily as a soft snow ski.

1005," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1051," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1074," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1120," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1143," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1189," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1212," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1258," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1281," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1327," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1350," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1396," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1419," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1465," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1488," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1534," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1557," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1603," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1626," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1672," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1695," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1741," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1764," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1810," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1833," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1879," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1902," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1948," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1971," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?
