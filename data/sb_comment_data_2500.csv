133,"Maybe smth like a hybrid camber with not too much camber with a medium-soft flex would be good for you (that was my first board hehe). It also really depends on where you are in terms of progression at the moment. When I bought my first board I knew I wanted to focus on freestyle so this type of board is good to use for growing into intermediate at park (but not every board with this profile is, mine specifically is also a twin so that I could ride switch with ease and you need to take other specs into account). However it is also a good board type to practice for beginners, even though it would get some getting used to for sure. I first learned on a stiff rental board and I found turn initiation much easier on a softer hybrid camber profile. It took me time to get used to handling bumps and uneven terrain on the hybrid camber (harder) but I felt it was easier to maneuver too. From my personal experience, I grew out of the rental board pretty quickly and was very satisfied to use the board I bought. It also depends on your experience in board sports I think.

350,"Just try to take it slower. Go back to basics and practice your J turns on those open, steep slopes. So point it, turn on either edge, and head almost completely upwards on the slope, stop, then start again but use the other edge. Some really good advice I got for pointing it on steeps is to ""growl"" at the slope before going.

Depending on the mountain, you've got to do a lot of rope/snow fence work, traverses, etc. and it's just much easier to be mobile on skis.

540,"Pretzels are kind of a hard trick to explain with words. Think about over the course of the trick from lip to landing you do what aggregates to a frontside 180. Both on jumps and out of rails Spins are initiated with hips and shoulders, and we have some amount of control with how quickly we pull our legs along into the rotation.

To me it looks like you’re not really initiating rotation off of the lip as you jump into your front board, and trying to come up with the spin at the end. When I do front board pretzels I start by riding into the rail with my hips and shoulders “pre- oriented”backside. Then I move my hips in sort of a fs 180 motion as I pop off of the lip of the takeoff, while I lock onto the rail in an independent and opposite motion with my feet. Basically I jump into and lock in to my front board under my front foot, then I pivot my hips and shoulder in a frontside rotation while on the rail. This means that when I pop off the end of the rail my hips and shoulders are oriented and pushing in a direction to initiate the frontside spin out. And then you do still have to kind of reach that back foot around in front. This is a trick you kind of have to lean into with your leading hip and shoulder.

If you look at your own body in the clip, on the spin out you are fighting against your shoulders which don’t really have rotation of their own.

613,"Looking for a new board after having the same one for 20 years, need advice. I've had a rigid, apparently short (like 158?), directional board for the entire time I've been snowboarding. Somehow I managed to learn on it. I realized I had outgrown it when I had to put my bindings on the very last holes at each side. This makes the tips kind of short on the outsides of the bindings; the board being directional, it is shorter on one tip than the other.

I am 6'3""(191cm), 190 lbs(86kg) and recently became more interested in tricks and more motivated to learn them as I now live closer to a resort so I wanted to make sure I could get a board that I could practice butters on but also hit some jumps probably. Not that worried about grinds/rails. There is no powder at this resort, like... ever. Given Ohio's climate, there's more ice than powder. But I still do want to be able to go down piste stably.

I've been looking at the Solomon assassin and the Jones mountain twin as those are a couple of boards that go up to the sizes that I need. I would love a Capita DOA but it doesn't seem like they make them long enough for me. I'll need a wide board that's at least 260 mm across as I have a US size 12 foot. given my wide stance I'm figuring on at least 163 length leaning towards 165.

632,"I need a new snowboard (preferably powder board) and would like advice! Here's my info:

Female, 5'1"", 135lbs. (Mostly muscle, I am quite fit)
Expert-level rider who loves riding powder/off-piste, weaving through right trees, and getting air off cliff drops and side hits.
I charge hard and ride very aggressively and pretty fast.
I like to ride switch but don't do it too often in the trees, and want a directional board.
I also love to ride park, but my current board should hold up as a park board for another season or two.

My current board is a 2012 Bataleon Distortia 143. I love it, but I definitely want a board for powder that floats a lot better. PS this is basically my only board ever besides the K2 I learned on.

I work at Monarch Mountain in Colorado, and as an employee I get a discount with Weston and Never Summer, not sure about other brands.
With that in mind, I've mostly been looking at the Weston Eclipse (solid not split) 145, Never Summer Lady West 144, and Never Summer Harpoon 144.
I'm also open to other brands (like Jones or Bataleon), but I'd like to spend under $400 so it depends if I can get a discount.

Mainly I want a board that floats in powder and feels kinda surfy (I am a surfer also), has good maneuverability in tight trees, is semi-stiff but has some flex, has good edge hold and can survive groomers, and charges hard.

Has anyone ridden any of those boards I mentioned? Or have other suggestions/reviews?

672,"If you can go get fitted by a ski shop bootfitter. Your boots are crucial to your enjoyment.  Too loose or too tight you will have a bad time. I would say boots are one of the pieces of gear (if you can) to buy new for this reason. That said you can find good used boots but if you’re not experienced with fit it is hit or miss. 

Helmet- get whatever is comfortable. Lots of used gear places sell them and new for cheap. 

Goggles- depends where you’re riding but you can pick up a pair of cheaper everyday lense goggles. If you plan on doing this sport for a long time it would be worth it to get a goggle that has interchangeable lenses that you can go back over time and pick up more lenses for the various sun /cloudy/stormy conditions you may encounter. Zionor, smith, even blenders are good places to check out. Zionor and blenders tend to be on the cheaper side of smith. 

Pants and jacket - nothing wrong with starting with used gear here. You want at least 10k waterproofing. Gore-tex is the high end waterproof and wind proofing but last a long time. Ideally as a new snowboarder you will want a longer coat that goes over your butt or some extremely waterproof pants. You will spend a decent amount of time on your butt while learning. This means wet/cold butt as snow freezes on your pants.

908,"You've got the idea for sure, you mostly just need more time on your board to build that muscle memory so you can do the things you're doing more dynamically, with more power, and speed.

A couple tips to keep in mind:

Try pointing the direction you want to turn with your front arm, that will help you to be more dynamic in your turn initiation. 

You have your knees bent, great!  Now you want to be more dynamic again, popping up just a little to initiate the turn, then coming back down to finish it.  This will help you unweight and reweight your board for easier and less sketch turns.

Try going a little faster, moving so slowly isn't making things easier.  Going faster will let you use more toe and heel pressure from which you can move with more power.

Honestly most beginners are worse than you, but you were still bending at the waist too much, your shoulders should more or less be over your board for beginner turns.

You are linking turns, that's great; learning accelerates from here.  Get more time on the board and concentrate on moving with more conviction and power and you'll be shredding in no time.

If you watch the video you can see that your left leg is bent and your right leg is straight. Try focusing on having the same weight on both feet while making your turns. You do want to lean back when you are in powder to keep your nose from diving and catching the snow but other than that you really shouldn’t be leaning back at all. Try standing up straight with even weight on both feet while you are “neutral” or not making a turn, and as you make your turn you can lean back to make a sharper turn but for just cruising back and forth like you are here just stand up straight relax and focus on your feet! The better you get the more you will find yourself standing up straight very relaxed and using very small weight adjustments on your feet.

Also is there much in the way of tighter tree runs out where you ride? You will definitely need a wide board because of your boot size. My recommendations at the moment are the Capita mercury, the outsiders, Marhar lumberjack or lumberjack x(not sure whether or not they sell in Europe), Wired directive(not sure if they sell in Europe yet either), Yes Jackpot, DC PLY(if you’re on a budget), Jones Mountain Twin, and Bataleon Goliath.

I would recommend you look for a board from within the last 8 years and bindings from within the last 5 years, and make sure they aren’t bargain basement crap either(capix, chamonix, etc.). If you’re looking for new gear, the first board I always recommend for beginners is the yes basic followed by the Burton Kilroy twin, both are solid camber 2.0 boards that are relatively affordable as far as new snowboards go, and can be paired up with lower end, softer bindings just fine.

I ski up at big white in BC, and have spent the majority of my past 3 days up at the hill in the shop trying to figure this out. Whenever I take a run longer than a couple minutes I start to get a burning pain in my foot right behind the forefoot that wont go away until I sit for a while or massage my foot out. If I continue to ride with the pain (in the case of a long, slow run) it gets worse and worse until its excruciating. It wasn't a problem when I was snowplowing down the mountain on heel-edge and I can feel it get worse when I have to hold a long toe-edge, so it must have something to do with that.

I have already:

Adjusted my bindings like crazy

replaced my bindings

Got custom orthotics ($$$)

Got those custom orthotics modified a couple times

Got heel lifts

Removed heel lifts.

The kind people at the shop up there don't know what to do with me, and I'm starting to feel bad for coming up so often. At this point they have basically said I should try to eliminate any use of my feet when going toe-edge and rely solely on my knees/hips. Maybe I'm just not great at doing this but it doesn't seem to make a difference when I'm actively trying to do this vs just riding what I would normally. They both become excruciatingly painful eventually. The last thing they suggest is to get boots that don't utilize a ""single boa"" and to pick up ones with laces or a double boa, but its not really in my price range to pick up a new, more expensive pair of boots months after buying these.

I'm grasping at straws at this point, I love boarding but man am I stuck on what to do next. My ski boots weren't even this bad, and they were one of my biggest motivators for switching. So if anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it, thanks guys.

I should add that the pain is similar to what I would get if I were to hold myself up on my toes for an extended period of time.",1,hi i m new to snowboarding after skiing most of my life i got a setup this season with an older used board some used but nice bindings and new ride jackson boots i have very flat feet and it was always a problem with skiing but i didn t think it would be as much of an issue with snowboarding man was i wrong i ski up at big white in bc and have spent the majority of my past 3 days up at the hill in the shop trying to figure this out whenever i take a run longer than a couple minutes i start to get a burning pain in my foot right behind the forefoot that wont go away until i sit for a while or massage my foot out if i continue to ride with the pain in the case of a long slow run it gets worse and worse until its excruciating it wasn t a problem when i was snowplowing down the mountain on heel edge and i can feel it get worse when i have to hold a long toe edge so it must have something to do with that i have already adjusted my bindings like crazy replaced my bindings got custom orthotics got those custom orthotics modified a couple times got heel lifts removed heel lifts the kind people at the shop up there don t know what to do with me and i m starting to feel bad for coming up so often at this point they have basically said i should try to eliminate any use of my feet when going toe edge and rely solely on my knees hips maybe i m just not great at doing this but it doesn t seem to make a difference when i m actively trying to do this vs just riding what i would normally they both become excruciatingly painful eventually the last thing they suggest is to get boots that don t utilize a single boa and to pick up ones with laces or a double boa but its not really in my price range to pick up a new more expensive pair of boots months after buying these i m grasping at straws at this point i love boarding but man am i stuck on what to do next my ski boots weren t even this bad and they were one of my biggest motivators for switching so if anyone has any suggestions i would really appreciate it thanks guys i should add that the pain is similar to what i would get if i were to hold myself up on my toes for an extended period of time,hi new life got setup season older used used nice bindings new jackson boots flat feet problem think issue man wrong big white bc spent majority past days hill shop trying figure run longer couple minutes start burning pain foot right forefoot wont away sit massage foot continue pain case long slow run gets worse worse excruciating problem snowplowing mountain heel edge feel worse hold long toe edge adjusted bindings like crazy replaced bindings got custom orthotics got custom orthotics modified couple times got heel lifts removed heel lifts kind people shop know starting feel bad coming point basically said try eliminate use feet going toe edge rely solely knees hips maybe great make difference actively trying vs normally excruciatingly painful eventually thing suggest boots utilize single boa pick ones laces double boa really price range pick new expensive pair boots months buying grasping straws point love man stuck boots bad biggest motivators switching suggestions really appreciate thanks guys add pain similar hold toes extended period time,hi new life got setup season older use use nice bind new jackson boot flat feet problem think issu man wrong big white bc spent major past day hill shop tri figur run longer coupl minut start burn pain foot right forefoot wont away sit massag foot continu pain case long slow run get wors wors excruci problem snowplow mountain heel edg feel wors hold long toe edg adjust bind like crazi replac bind got custom orthot got custom orthot modifi coupl time got heel lift remov heel lift kind peopl shop know start feel bad come point basic said tri elimin use feet go toe edg reli sole knee hip mayb great make differ activ tri vs normal excruciatingli pain eventu thing suggest boot util singl boa pick one lace doubl boa realli price rang pick new expens pair boot month buy grasp straw point love man stuck boot bad biggest motiv switch suggest realli appreci thank guy add pain similar hold toe extend period time,0.152,0.743,0.105,-0.8591,0

Another way to think of it is you’re unweighting the board to transition, which is already occurring on a smaller scale just within your foot movement. You’re just going to start exaggerating it more, both in the unweighting between turns, and then when you push harder into the snow in the deepest point in the turn",1,when skidding turns it s probably easiest to think about this if your turns are more or less symmetrical across the fall line straight down the run if you re on edge carving this can be more dynamic as well it s easy to make several carved turns in one direction across the fall line kinda like surfing a wave you can basically go uphill check your blind spots first another way to think of it is you re unweighting the board to transition which is already occurring on a smaller scale just within your foot movement you re just going to start exaggerating it more both in the unweighting between turns and then when you push harder into the snow in the deepest point in the turn,skidding turns probably easiest think turns symmetrical fall line straight run edge carving dynamic easy make carved turns direction fall line kinda like wave basically uphill check blind spots way think unweighting transition occurring smaller scale foot movement going start exaggerating unweighting turns push harder snow deepest point turn,skid turn probabl easiest think turn symmetr fall line straight run edg carv dynam easi make carv turn direct fall line kinda like wave basic uphil check blind spot way think unweight transit occur smaller scale foot movement go start exagger unweight turn push harder snow deepest point turn,0.049,0.824,0.126,0.4951,0

1841,"Here's my tips...

1) slow down, speed will come.  Don't try and rush it. 

2) You need to ""set the edge"" and then ""lean into the edge"" if you really want to start carving rather than skid turning.  So at a slower speeder practice going back and forth on your toe edge to heel edge even.  So you should be going mostly straighting just when you do this.   When you skid turn, your never really ""setting the edge"". 

3) On your carves you should have ""knees bending"" as your carve and get lower. Then to transitions to your other side you should ""stand up"" out of the carve to then ""Bend knees"" again into your next turn.  So....sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up.  Think of those cues as you turn.  turning = bending knees.  Transitions to next turn = standing up.

Right now it looks like you aren't quite linking your turns together and more so skidding between turns. That's like turning by using the brakes.

On a nice hard pack or corduroy you can start to really pressure the board with your front foot. Controlling how you pressure the different sides of your foot(think: heel, front edge, toes) into the board will control how the front edges around the nose of your board will start to bite into or hookup with the snow. Once you start using your front edge to initiate the turn you will find your board really starting to get on edge, then you'll start to feel how your back foot can assist with this process. 

If you ever need to you'll still be able to kick out your back foot to slam on the breaks or give a simple speed check. But yeah, in general try to get more of your weight onto your front foot and start using your edges to make turns.

1972,"&gt;	That’s not bad but if she wants to improve she needs to be riding steeper slopes. 

I agree with this. Beginners should be pushed onto blues as soon as they start making consistent connected turns without catching an edge. It’s easy to ride the wave of excitement that comes with this phase of learning and to expand into more challenging runs. On the other hand, if you let the wave pass and get stuck on easy trails, you’re more likely to stagnate as you become subject to self preservation instincts that will prevent you from advancing.

&gt;	Snowboarding requires a certain level of speed for control.

This is dead false though. The most valuable lesson I ever got was when my trainer dragged me out to a bunny slope to practice euro turns on his old alpine board. “Control” does not require speed. It requires being in tune with your body and gear, and internalizing the physics of what you’re trying to do.

2111,"Hey y'all. Been getting back into snowboarding. I'm 5'11 170lbs and ride mostly groomers with the wife. Love to carve deep and hard with some butters (Knapton wannabe?) I bought a 153 2017 Gnu Space Case a couple years back to get better at butters and retired my 157 2008/9? Ride Antic. 

I love the switchability on the Gnu and how easy buttering and powder are, but I really want a better hard carver. I demo'd a few boards last season and really enjoyed the Huck Knife but was thinking something a little stiffer would be nice. I can't justify the price of a Knapton Twin, but would like a similar board. Butterability is less important on this board and maybe taking it some powder when it's there would be nice. I also want some responsive bindings that have canted beds and NO mini disc. 

After several hours of research on thegoodride, angry snowboarder, and snowboarding profiles I'm currently thinking the 158 Salomon Ultimate Ride or Signal Disruptor fit the bill for the board and the Union Force for bindings.

Am I missing any options? Should I go 155?",1,hey y all been getting back into snowboarding i m 5 11 170lbs and ride mostly groomers with the wife love to carve deep and hard with some butters knapton wannabe i bought a 153 2017 gnu space case a couple years back to get better at butters and retired my 157 2008 9 ride antic i love the switchability on the gnu and how easy buttering and powder are but i really want a better hard carver i demo d a few boards last season and really enjoyed the huck knife but was thinking something a little stiffer would be nice i can t justify the price of a knapton twin but would like a similar board butterability is less important on this board and maybe taking it some powder when it s there would be nice i also want some responsive bindings that have canted beds and no mini disc after several hours of research on thegoodride angry snowboarder and snowboarding profiles i m currently thinking the 158 salomon ultimate ride or signal disruptor fit the bill for the board and the union force for bindings am i missing any options should i go 155,hey getting 11 170lbs groomers wife love carve deep hard butters knapton wannabe bought 153 2017 gnu space case couple years better butters retired 157 2008 antic love switchability gnu easy buttering powder really want better hard carver demo season really enjoyed huck knife thinking little stiffer nice justify price knapton twin like similar butterability important maybe taking powder nice want responsive bindings canted beds mini disc hours research thegoodride angry profiles currently thinking 158 salomon ultimate signal disruptor fit union force bindings missing options 155,hey get 11 170lb groomer wife love carv deep hard butter knapton wannab bought 153 2017 gnu space case coupl year better butter retir 157 2008 antic love switchabl gnu easi butter powder realli want better hard carver demo season realli enjoy huck knife think littl stiffer nice justifi price knapton twin like similar butter import mayb take powder nice want respons bind cant bed mini disc hour research thegoodrid angri profil current think 158 salomon ultim signal disruptor fit union forc bind miss option 155,0.041,0.673,0.286,0.9781,0
