133,"Maybe smth like a hybrid camber with not too much camber with a medium-soft flex would be good for you (that was my first board hehe). It also really depends on where you are in terms of progression at the moment. When I bought my first board I knew I wanted to focus on freestyle so this type of board is good to use for growing into intermediate at park (but not every board with this profile is, mine specifically is also a twin so that I could ride switch with ease and you need to take other specs into account). However it is also a good board type to practice for beginners, even though it would get some getting used to for sure. I first learned on a stiff rental board and I found turn initiation much easier on a softer hybrid camber profile. It took me time to get used to handling bumps and uneven terrain on the hybrid camber (harder) but I felt it was easier to maneuver too. From my personal experience, I grew out of the rental board pretty quickly and was very satisfied to use the board I bought. It also depends on your experience in board sports I think.

350,"Just try to take it slower. Go back to basics and practice your J turns on those open, steep slopes. So point it, turn on either edge, and head almost completely upwards on the slope, stop, then start again but use the other edge. Some really good advice I got for pointing it on steeps is to ""growl"" at the slope before going.

Depending on the mountain, you've got to do a lot of rope/snow fence work, traverses, etc. and it's just much easier to be mobile on skis.

540,"Pretzels are kind of a hard trick to explain with words. Think about over the course of the trick from lip to landing you do what aggregates to a frontside 180. Both on jumps and out of rails Spins are initiated with hips and shoulders, and we have some amount of control with how quickly we pull our legs along into the rotation.

To me it looks like you’re not really initiating rotation off of the lip as you jump into your front board, and trying to come up with the spin at the end. When I do front board pretzels I start by riding into the rail with my hips and shoulders “pre- oriented”backside. Then I move my hips in sort of a fs 180 motion as I pop off of the lip of the takeoff, while I lock onto the rail in an independent and opposite motion with my feet. Basically I jump into and lock in to my front board under my front foot, then I pivot my hips and shoulder in a frontside rotation while on the rail. This means that when I pop off the end of the rail my hips and shoulders are oriented and pushing in a direction to initiate the frontside spin out. And then you do still have to kind of reach that back foot around in front. This is a trick you kind of have to lean into with your leading hip and shoulder.

If you look at your own body in the clip, on the spin out you are fighting against your shoulders which don’t really have rotation of their own.

613,"Looking for a new board after having the same one for 20 years, need advice. I've had a rigid, apparently short (like 158?), directional board for the entire time I've been snowboarding. Somehow I managed to learn on it. I realized I had outgrown it when I had to put my bindings on the very last holes at each side. This makes the tips kind of short on the outsides of the bindings; the board being directional, it is shorter on one tip than the other.

I am 6'3""(191cm), 190 lbs(86kg) and recently became more interested in tricks and more motivated to learn them as I now live closer to a resort so I wanted to make sure I could get a board that I could practice butters on but also hit some jumps probably. Not that worried about grinds/rails. There is no powder at this resort, like... ever. Given Ohio's climate, there's more ice than powder. But I still do want to be able to go down piste stably.

I've been looking at the Solomon assassin and the Jones mountain twin as those are a couple of boards that go up to the sizes that I need. I would love a Capita DOA but it doesn't seem like they make them long enough for me. I'll need a wide board that's at least 260 mm across as I have a US size 12 foot. given my wide stance I'm figuring on at least 163 length leaning towards 165.

632,"I need a new snowboard (preferably powder board) and would like advice! Here's my info:

Female, 5'1"", 135lbs. (Mostly muscle, I am quite fit)
Expert-level rider who loves riding powder/off-piste, weaving through right trees, and getting air off cliff drops and side hits.
I charge hard and ride very aggressively and pretty fast.
I like to ride switch but don't do it too often in the trees, and want a directional board.
I also love to ride park, but my current board should hold up as a park board for another season or two.

My current board is a 2012 Bataleon Distortia 143. I love it, but I definitely want a board for powder that floats a lot better. PS this is basically my only board ever besides the K2 I learned on.

I work at Monarch Mountain in Colorado, and as an employee I get a discount with Weston and Never Summer, not sure about other brands.
With that in mind, I've mostly been looking at the Weston Eclipse (solid not split) 145, Never Summer Lady West 144, and Never Summer Harpoon 144.
I'm also open to other brands (like Jones or Bataleon), but I'd like to spend under $400 so it depends if I can get a discount.

Mainly I want a board that floats in powder and feels kinda surfy (I am a surfer also), has good maneuverability in tight trees, is semi-stiff but has some flex, has good edge hold and can survive groomers, and charges hard.

Has anyone ridden any of those boards I mentioned? Or have other suggestions/reviews?

672,"If you can go get fitted by a ski shop bootfitter. Your boots are crucial to your enjoyment.  Too loose or too tight you will have a bad time. I would say boots are one of the pieces of gear (if you can) to buy new for this reason. That said you can find good used boots but if you’re not experienced with fit it is hit or miss. 

Helmet- get whatever is comfortable. Lots of used gear places sell them and new for cheap. 

Goggles- depends where you’re riding but you can pick up a pair of cheaper everyday lense goggles. If you plan on doing this sport for a long time it would be worth it to get a goggle that has interchangeable lenses that you can go back over time and pick up more lenses for the various sun /cloudy/stormy conditions you may encounter. Zionor, smith, even blenders are good places to check out. Zionor and blenders tend to be on the cheaper side of smith. 

Pants and jacket - nothing wrong with starting with used gear here. You want at least 10k waterproofing. Gore-tex is the high end waterproof and wind proofing but last a long time. Ideally as a new snowboarder you will want a longer coat that goes over your butt or some extremely waterproof pants. You will spend a decent amount of time on your butt while learning. This means wet/cold butt as snow freezes on your pants.

908,"You've got the idea for sure, you mostly just need more time on your board to build that muscle memory so you can do the things you're doing more dynamically, with more power, and speed.

A couple tips to keep in mind:

Try pointing the direction you want to turn with your front arm, that will help you to be more dynamic in your turn initiation. 

You have your knees bent, great!  Now you want to be more dynamic again, popping up just a little to initiate the turn, then coming back down to finish it.  This will help you unweight and reweight your board for easier and less sketch turns.

Try going a little faster, moving so slowly isn't making things easier.  Going faster will let you use more toe and heel pressure from which you can move with more power.

Honestly most beginners are worse than you, but you were still bending at the waist too much, your shoulders should more or less be over your board for beginner turns.

You are linking turns, that's great; learning accelerates from here.  Get more time on the board and concentrate on moving with more conviction and power and you'll be shredding in no time.

If you watch the video you can see that your left leg is bent and your right leg is straight. Try focusing on having the same weight on both feet while making your turns. You do want to lean back when you are in powder to keep your nose from diving and catching the snow but other than that you really shouldn’t be leaning back at all. Try standing up straight with even weight on both feet while you are “neutral” or not making a turn, and as you make your turn you can lean back to make a sharper turn but for just cruising back and forth like you are here just stand up straight relax and focus on your feet! The better you get the more you will find yourself standing up straight very relaxed and using very small weight adjustments on your feet.

Also is there much in the way of tighter tree runs out where you ride? You will definitely need a wide board because of your boot size. My recommendations at the moment are the Capita mercury, the outsiders, Marhar lumberjack or lumberjack x(not sure whether or not they sell in Europe), Wired directive(not sure if they sell in Europe yet either), Yes Jackpot, DC PLY(if you’re on a budget), Jones Mountain Twin, and Bataleon Goliath.

I would recommend you look for a board from within the last 8 years and bindings from within the last 5 years, and make sure they aren’t bargain basement crap either(capix, chamonix, etc.). If you’re looking for new gear, the first board I always recommend for beginners is the yes basic followed by the Burton Kilroy twin, both are solid camber 2.0 boards that are relatively affordable as far as new snowboards go, and can be paired up with lower end, softer bindings just fine.

I ski up at big white in BC, and have spent the majority of my past 3 days up at the hill in the shop trying to figure this out. Whenever I take a run longer than a couple minutes I start to get a burning pain in my foot right behind the forefoot that wont go away until I sit for a while or massage my foot out. If I continue to ride with the pain (in the case of a long, slow run) it gets worse and worse until its excruciating. It wasn't a problem when I was snowplowing down the mountain on heel-edge and I can feel it get worse when I have to hold a long toe-edge, so it must have something to do with that.

I have already:

Adjusted my bindings like crazy

replaced my bindings

Got custom orthotics ($$$)

Got those custom orthotics modified a couple times

Got heel lifts

Removed heel lifts.

The kind people at the shop up there don't know what to do with me, and I'm starting to feel bad for coming up so often. At this point they have basically said I should try to eliminate any use of my feet when going toe-edge and rely solely on my knees/hips. Maybe I'm just not great at doing this but it doesn't seem to make a difference when I'm actively trying to do this vs just riding what I would normally. They both become excruciatingly painful eventually. The last thing they suggest is to get boots that don't utilize a ""single boa"" and to pick up ones with laces or a double boa, but its not really in my price range to pick up a new, more expensive pair of boots months after buying these.

I'm grasping at straws at this point, I love boarding but man am I stuck on what to do next. My ski boots weren't even this bad, and they were one of my biggest motivators for switching. So if anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it, thanks guys.

I should add that the pain is similar to what I would get if I were to hold myself up on my toes for an extended period of time.",1,hi i m new to snowboarding after skiing most of my life i got a setup this season with an older used board some used but nice bindings and new ride jackson boots i have very flat feet and it was always a problem with skiing but i didn t think it would be as much of an issue with snowboarding man was i wrong i ski up at big white in bc and have spent the majority of my past 3 days up at the hill in the shop trying to figure this out whenever i take a run longer than a couple minutes i start to get a burning pain in my foot right behind the forefoot that wont go away until i sit for a while or massage my foot out if i continue to ride with the pain in the case of a long slow run it gets worse and worse until its excruciating it wasn t a problem when i was snowplowing down the mountain on heel edge and i can feel it get worse when i have to hold a long toe edge so it must have something to do with that i have already adjusted my bindings like crazy replaced my bindings got custom orthotics got those custom orthotics modified a couple times got heel lifts removed heel lifts the kind people at the shop up there don t know what to do with me and i m starting to feel bad for coming up so often at this point they have basically said i should try to eliminate any use of my feet when going toe edge and rely solely on my knees hips maybe i m just not great at doing this but it doesn t seem to make a difference when i m actively trying to do this vs just riding what i would normally they both become excruciatingly painful eventually the last thing they suggest is to get boots that don t utilize a single boa and to pick up ones with laces or a double boa but its not really in my price range to pick up a new more expensive pair of boots months after buying these i m grasping at straws at this point i love boarding but man am i stuck on what to do next my ski boots weren t even this bad and they were one of my biggest motivators for switching so if anyone has any suggestions i would really appreciate it thanks guys i should add that the pain is similar to what i would get if i were to hold myself up on my toes for an extended period of time,hi new life got setup season older used used nice bindings new jackson boots flat feet problem think issue man wrong big white bc spent majority past days hill shop trying figure run longer couple minutes start burning pain foot right forefoot wont away sit massage foot continue pain case long slow run gets worse worse excruciating problem snowplowing mountain heel edge feel worse hold long toe edge adjusted bindings like crazy replaced bindings got custom orthotics got custom orthotics modified couple times got heel lifts removed heel lifts kind people shop know starting feel bad coming point basically said try eliminate use feet going toe edge rely solely knees hips maybe great make difference actively trying vs normally excruciatingly painful eventually thing suggest boots utilize single boa pick ones laces double boa really price range pick new expensive pair boots months buying grasping straws point love man stuck boots bad biggest motivators switching suggestions really appreciate thanks guys add pain similar hold toes extended period time,hi new life got setup season older use use nice bind new jackson boot flat feet problem think issu man wrong big white bc spent major past day hill shop tri figur run longer coupl minut start burn pain foot right forefoot wont away sit massag foot continu pain case long slow run get wors wors excruci problem snowplow mountain heel edg feel wors hold long toe edg adjust bind like crazi replac bind got custom orthot got custom orthot modifi coupl time got heel lift remov heel lift kind peopl shop know start feel bad come point basic said tri elimin use feet go toe edg reli sole knee hip mayb great make differ activ tri vs normal excruciatingli pain eventu thing suggest boot util singl boa pick one lace doubl boa realli price rang pick new expens pair boot month buy grasp straw point love man stuck boot bad biggest motiv switch suggest realli appreci thank guy add pain similar hold toe extend period time,0.152,0.743,0.105,-0.8591,0

Another way to think of it is you’re unweighting the board to transition, which is already occurring on a smaller scale just within your foot movement. You’re just going to start exaggerating it more, both in the unweighting between turns, and then when you push harder into the snow in the deepest point in the turn",1,when skidding turns it s probably easiest to think about this if your turns are more or less symmetrical across the fall line straight down the run if you re on edge carving this can be more dynamic as well it s easy to make several carved turns in one direction across the fall line kinda like surfing a wave you can basically go uphill check your blind spots first another way to think of it is you re unweighting the board to transition which is already occurring on a smaller scale just within your foot movement you re just going to start exaggerating it more both in the unweighting between turns and then when you push harder into the snow in the deepest point in the turn,skidding turns probably easiest think turns symmetrical fall line straight run edge carving dynamic easy make carved turns direction fall line kinda like wave basically uphill check blind spots way think unweighting transition occurring smaller scale foot movement going start exaggerating unweighting turns push harder snow deepest point turn,skid turn probabl easiest think turn symmetr fall line straight run edg carv dynam easi make carv turn direct fall line kinda like wave basic uphil check blind spot way think unweight transit occur smaller scale foot movement go start exagger unweight turn push harder snow deepest point turn,0.049,0.824,0.126,0.4951,0

1841,"Here's my tips...

1) slow down, speed will come.  Don't try and rush it. 

2) You need to ""set the edge"" and then ""lean into the edge"" if you really want to start carving rather than skid turning.  So at a slower speeder practice going back and forth on your toe edge to heel edge even.  So you should be going mostly straighting just when you do this.   When you skid turn, your never really ""setting the edge"". 

3) On your carves you should have ""knees bending"" as your carve and get lower. Then to transitions to your other side you should ""stand up"" out of the carve to then ""Bend knees"" again into your next turn.  So....sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up.  Think of those cues as you turn.  turning = bending knees.  Transitions to next turn = standing up.

Right now it looks like you aren't quite linking your turns together and more so skidding between turns. That's like turning by using the brakes.

On a nice hard pack or corduroy you can start to really pressure the board with your front foot. Controlling how you pressure the different sides of your foot(think: heel, front edge, toes) into the board will control how the front edges around the nose of your board will start to bite into or hookup with the snow. Once you start using your front edge to initiate the turn you will find your board really starting to get on edge, then you'll start to feel how your back foot can assist with this process. 

If you ever need to you'll still be able to kick out your back foot to slam on the breaks or give a simple speed check. But yeah, in general try to get more of your weight onto your front foot and start using your edges to make turns.

1972,"&gt;	That’s not bad but if she wants to improve she needs to be riding steeper slopes. 

I agree with this. Beginners should be pushed onto blues as soon as they start making consistent connected turns without catching an edge. It’s easy to ride the wave of excitement that comes with this phase of learning and to expand into more challenging runs. On the other hand, if you let the wave pass and get stuck on easy trails, you’re more likely to stagnate as you become subject to self preservation instincts that will prevent you from advancing.

&gt;	Snowboarding requires a certain level of speed for control.

This is dead false though. The most valuable lesson I ever got was when my trainer dragged me out to a bunny slope to practice euro turns on his old alpine board. “Control” does not require speed. It requires being in tune with your body and gear, and internalizing the physics of what you’re trying to do.

2111,"Hey y'all. Been getting back into snowboarding. I'm 5'11 170lbs and ride mostly groomers with the wife. Love to carve deep and hard with some butters (Knapton wannabe?) I bought a 153 2017 Gnu Space Case a couple years back to get better at butters and retired my 157 2008/9? Ride Antic. 

I love the switchability on the Gnu and how easy buttering and powder are, but I really want a better hard carver. I demo'd a few boards last season and really enjoyed the Huck Knife but was thinking something a little stiffer would be nice. I can't justify the price of a Knapton Twin, but would like a similar board. Butterability is less important on this board and maybe taking it some powder when it's there would be nice. I also want some responsive bindings that have canted beds and NO mini disc. 

After several hours of research on thegoodride, angry snowboarder, and snowboarding profiles I'm currently thinking the 158 Salomon Ultimate Ride or Signal Disruptor fit the bill for the board and the Union Force for bindings.

Am I missing any options? Should I go 155?",1,hey y all been getting back into snowboarding i m 5 11 170lbs and ride mostly groomers with the wife love to carve deep and hard with some butters knapton wannabe i bought a 153 2017 gnu space case a couple years back to get better at butters and retired my 157 2008 9 ride antic i love the switchability on the gnu and how easy buttering and powder are but i really want a better hard carver i demo d a few boards last season and really enjoyed the huck knife but was thinking something a little stiffer would be nice i can t justify the price of a knapton twin but would like a similar board butterability is less important on this board and maybe taking it some powder when it s there would be nice i also want some responsive bindings that have canted beds and no mini disc after several hours of research on thegoodride angry snowboarder and snowboarding profiles i m currently thinking the 158 salomon ultimate ride or signal disruptor fit the bill for the board and the union force for bindings am i missing any options should i go 155,hey getting 11 170lbs groomers wife love carve deep hard butters knapton wannabe bought 153 2017 gnu space case couple years better butters retired 157 2008 antic love switchability gnu easy buttering powder really want better hard carver demo season really enjoyed huck knife thinking little stiffer nice justify price knapton twin like similar butterability important maybe taking powder nice want responsive bindings canted beds mini disc hours research thegoodride angry profiles currently thinking 158 salomon ultimate signal disruptor fit union force bindings missing options 155,hey get 11 170lb groomer wife love carv deep hard butter knapton wannab bought 153 2017 gnu space case coupl year better butter retir 157 2008 antic love switchabl gnu easi butter powder realli want better hard carver demo season realli enjoy huck knife think littl stiffer nice justifi price knapton twin like similar butter import mayb take powder nice want respons bind cant bed mini disc hour research thegoodrid angri profil current think 158 salomon ultim signal disruptor fit union forc bind miss option 155,0.041,0.673,0.286,0.9781,0

2651,"Looks like going from heel edge to toe edge you are doing pretty well. Every time you make a turn from your toe edge to heel edge, it looks like your upper body is doing too much and throwing you off balance, so that's where you need to focus for improvement. Instead of kicking your board out with your back foot to switch directions, you want to take a little more time to let the toe-to-heel transition happen. Let your right foot relax and flatten out a little bit while your back foot stays flexed to keep the edge, and the board will twist and naturally start to turn back towards the fall line. Don't try to get onto your heel edge until the board is already pointing straight down the hill. You'll pick up some extra speed, so go to a flatter run or try it in a flatter area first, but pretty soon you'll feel comfortable with that extra speed, knowing you have a solid heel side turn coming to be able to slow down once your board is pointing across the hill instead of straight down.

Assuming they fit me equally well, I'd prefer a TM3 to TM2 personally. Mostly because the TM3 has more rubber coverage on the outsole... the TM2 has a lot of exposed foam that I'd worry about billy goating on rocks while hiking. Again that's assuming equal fit, if the TM2 fit me better I'd grab the TM2.

Only direct insight I can provide is my XLTs had the same Performance liner as the TM2s, and that liner did not pack in much at all. I expected more pack-in than I got, and ended up selling the boots after about 15 days.

Footbeds aren't really a consideration for me, even the nice ones tend to be meh compared to a pair of cheap performance insoles. I toss mine in a box and toss in custom insoles.

If you're going to get bindings too, look at Union or Burton, no exceptions. Straps over step ins. (unless you need step ins because of a disability, they just don't give you the same board control) 

Id look at:

Union Flites (Cheap and quality, seriously the only cheap piece of SB equipment is this specific binding, around $100) 

Union Forces (Stiffer binding a little less forgiving then the Flites, better for snappier control, you'll be able to ride these longer before ""topping out"" the ability of the binding) 

Burton Cartel (One of the best all mountain bindings, super quick and secure straps)

I have a couple different pairs of bindings, Burton Missions, Burton Geniesis, Union Forces and the wife Union Contact Pros. By far, Burton has better straps and caps, But Union does have a lifetime warranty, all Union dealers have parts to fix bindings should they break.

And willfully miss my whole point of what we are currently wearing masks for: to reduce transmission to other people. It is successful in that. I never claimed any of this bullshit about bacterial pneumonia, that was you moving goalposts. The original claim was that “reusing masks doesn’t do shit” or something. That’s not true, I’ve addressed that and even addressed the unrelated stuff you’ve entered into the equation. I really don’t have any more time for this nonsense. Sure maybe never washing your cloth mask is going to lead to some bullshit but it still reduces transmission rates. That has been my only point and the only claim I’ve been interested in. 

You’re shooting wild because my point still stands of cloth masks regardless of reused or not, still physically blocking the shit you spray out your mouth and nose when talking or coughing or sneezing or just breathing. You can try to find ways to poke holes in the data but it seems pretty fucking clear at this point: put some shit over your face so you don’t go spraying your droplets everywhere. And yeah, we should probably wash them lol

You see this shit with antivaxxers, antimaskers, climate change deniers etc.... they find one piece of data that slightly fits their narrative and they manipulate and bastardize it and hinge their entire argument on it. So yeah, feel free to continue to hang onto his infection rates are higher in cloth masks when compared to ventilators and medical grade masks when all I’m saying is maybe cover your mouth like the experts have been saying for about a year now.

2961,"Yes you are correct, I have been riding for 24 years and have a strong background in skateboarding and surfing for much longer.

I don't teach snowboarding as my job/career. I have only taught to adults because they have asked.

Yes, my way of teaching will probably take a toll on someone that is not fit, but I think you are imagining that they point the nose down, pickup speed and hope that they turn. It's not the case for them. As I have observed, women tend to be more careful than men and learn with more control. They face the mountain and ride from one side of the trail to the other, guys like the speed and try to go fast. They are usually gung-ho about it.

Majority of the falls happen when they are linking their turns or just going down straight and catching an edge.

I don't take them to any blue runs to practice their linking turns, only to greens. Most of the time the blue trails turn into greens and depending on the season, terrain or groomers, part of the green is flat, they get tired skating it and most of the time they unbind and walk it. When asked to choose a trail all will pick a trail that is not flat. Hence why I don't take them to a green run.

As you already know leaning in powder versus groomed trails is a big difference, I take them to powder first because when they fall, they feel no pain.

I typically wear 11in shoes, but went a half size smaller because everyone was telling me you want boots where your toes are just slightly brushing up against the front of the boot. However, both times out this weekend my big toe on my back foot was killing me. I did 3 hours Friday night and then did another 4 on Saturday and I had to stop because it was starting to get difficult to turn and I was getting sloppy in my snowboarding.

(After confirming I was actually comfortable with it). He thought the bunny hill wasn’t helping me learn anymore because it wasn’t long or steep enough and he was right honestly. I barely fell and learned faster probably because I didn’t have to spend 30 minutes in line to get up the magic carpet for less than 1 minute of actual learning going down. But he was also willing to walk down the green run if I didn’t wanna board down it at any point lol. 

I was scared to take lessons honestly because ~ anxiety ~ so I’m grateful he was willing to teach me and basically run down the bunny hill in his boots for 3 hours in front of me which I doubt an instructor would’ve done.

Plenty of people just don't respond well to taking lessons from others they are close to. Maybe they feel more comfortable letting their frustrations show, who knows. The exact same lesson and words from a stranger don't lead to as much defensiveness for some reason.

The second point is about the instructor. Snowboarding is a complex process and it's not always easy to break it all down to a few key mechanics. Especially a self-taught rider trying to teach someone. Some people just simplify things better than others.

3151,"I’d recommend renting for the season and buying at the end when everything is on sale. At least for the board. 

If you have a good boot fitter in your area, by all means walk in and have them set you up with boots that feel amazing. If price isn’t an object get some custom insoles and a boot dryer (or your boots will stink like death, and putting on warm boots in the morning is amazing). A good boot fitter will not just size your feet, but have the equipment to heat up your inner boot and mold it to your leg, as well as talking to you about how you want to lace up your outer boot (there are several lacing options that balance speed of lacing vs how tight you can get individual points on your boots.) Don’t be afraid to get “men’s” boots if they feel better, literally no one cares but you. 

If money isn’t a problem rent a couple of different boards from a shop and take them up the hill to try out camber vs rocker (and the million different combinations) in a board and how you feel about them. The cheap option is get a rental for the season and do your internet research on what you should get. With so few days under your belt you may not notice all the technology people are willing to pay 850 for a board for just yet, which is why I recommend renting. Try your friend’s boards and find something you like before you commit, and then get one at the end of the season when it’s on sale. 

I don’t have a ton of knowledge on bindings other than if you get rear entry bindings in my experience you will hate them for the first several days until they’re perfectly dialed in, then you’ll probably love them. For normal strap in bindings the majority of offerings seem to offer difference in the stiffness of the high back and thats totally personal preference IMO. 

It sounds like you might be working at a ski resort this season, so I’m that case look into getting pro deals on your equipment. this can save you a ton (and if you work for the peanuts that a ski resort pays, you’ll need the savings). If you’re not an employee make friends with any you can as a regular. Those people know the best lines.

If you don’t know how to stop and you’re in the middle of a blue when your board is pointed down the fall line (straight down the hill) you’re going to get on your back leg by instinct and take off like a rocket and rag doll.

If you're not sure what you like/want with a board, one good option would be to see if there are any boards you could demo at Brighton to give you a better starting point. Otherwise, you'll mainly want something softer flex so it's easier to initiate turns while learning, and a board with rocker somewhere in its profile as that will make it more floaty &amp; less likely to catch an edge.

The main difference between men's &amp; women's boards is size range, width, and flex pattern.

3228,"Good advice! I was dating a girl and she wanted to try skiing as that was what the rest of her family did. I was mainly experienced in snowboarding but could do most runs at the North Carolina resorts on skis just fine. We rented our gear and I suggested a lesson for her, but she declined and insisted that since I learned both skiing and snowboarding without lessons so could she. A little argument and I give up. Fine, I’m not going to start a real fight; I figured she’d try the bunny hill, get tired, then want to stay in the warm clubhouse anyway. She tried the bunny hill a few times, not too well, and promptly decided she’d do better if there was a little more slope to get momentum going. Part of me agreed it’s easier to stay up with a little speed so I walk her through the lift process and what we have to do to get off, the bunny hill was just the conveyer belt type lift. 

She liked the lift. She decided she liked it way more than the idea of getting off the lift. She refused to get off the lift. This was not a resort that allowed you to ride back down on the lift. She refused to get off at each stop, and I continued to tell her that the runs get harder and harder the higher up the mountain we go. She won’t budge. We get to the last stop and they have to stop the lift so she’ll get off. Not embarrassing at all. Now we get to make it down the hardest trail of the park. 

It was not good, and she ended up with a sprained ankle. I ruined half a day of skiing for one run that was more like a 100 stop scoot down the hill so I can try to keep her safe. Haven’t gone up to the mountains with a partner since, but my wife is from Utah and skied growing up so maybe she will go one day.

3315,"When buying boots, go into a reputable board shop and get fitted for boots, try and ignore colour, lacing options, brand and price, as the best boot is the boot that fits your foot. 

Don’t buy cheap Amazon goggles ever. Try on goggles with your helmet and face mask if it’s possible.

For boards, people here may suggest beginner boards, but you won’t know whether you will really like a board until you’ve ridden it. That being said most of the boards I’ve seen suggested are solid boards. With board sizing female boards are usually narrower, and a bit lighter. I don’t see any reason why you must buy a female board, there are also typically less options when it comes to female boards as well. 

I don’t have any shop recommendations as I don’t live anywhere near either area unfortunately.

For good brands I’ll list them off here for you
Boots: Nidecker, Salomon, 32, Vans, DC, Rome, K2, Burton, Nitro, Ride(probably forgetting a couple brands)

3401,"So your two sources are: somebody loosely comparing infection rates and mask mandates over time (as if it's the only variable in play), and pictures of sneezes coming out of masks?? Obviously less droplets come out with a mask, but that's literally the only logical conclusion someone could pull from those sources.

They even stated this right at the end. From the NEJM study you linked: ""We did not assess the relative roles of droplets generated during speech, droplet nuclei, and aerosols in the transmission of viruses. Our aim was to provide visual evidence of speech-generated droplets and to qualitatively describe the effect of a damp cloth cover over the mouth to curb the emission of droplets.

So, your 'high-level studies' didn't actually show in any way way that how we wear masks necessarily helps...

I linked the study I did originally because even 100 years ago it was that fucking obvious to everyone that misusing masks can cause bacterial pneumonia. This point is such a non-controversy too, I honestly don't even know what you were seeing on google... Maybe you just read the headlines of your search (like those two studies you sent lmao), instead of actually reading the articles. Every 'fact-check' of masks causing bacterial pneumonia I've seen says two things: 1. This claim is false 2. If your mask is wet then this claim is true..... breath=moisture, buddy. 

Thanks for linking that 2015 study, at least. Wasn't going to use it myself, but hey I think it's worth considering what they said: ""This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.""

3452,"I'm a noob to snowboarding, but my foot pain is really starting to inhibit my progress and the amount of fun I have on the mountain. Every time I go snowboarding, pretty much from the point I'm kicking my board through the lift line, my feet absolutely fucking kill me. Halfway down a short run I'd have to pull over and loosen up my straps, boots, or just get off my feet for a bit while the pain subsided, and this happened pretty much every run. For brief moments of like a run or maybe two my feet feel absolutely fantastic and I feel no pain at all, but then it either comes back later or the next time I go snowboarding. I really need some advice or help on what could possibly be wrong because I can't see myself going up again just because of the severe amount of pain - even though I absolutely love snowboarding when it goes right.

Some background:

Because I'm just starting out, the most commonly stated reason for my foot pain is just because I have to get used to it. I've been up the mountain 4 times now for pretty much all day trips and, while I know that its far from experienced, everyone who I was going with said I shouldn't be in that much pain at that point. According to them, the amount of snowboarding I had been doing should have broken in the boots at least a bit by now.

I've tried tightening my boots, loosening them, tightening and loosening straps, and combinations of everything in between. They all lead to temporary relief (probably because I was sitting down when re-doing them) followed by more pain shortly after. It got so bad on my second that I just said fuck it and bought a 50 dollar pair of insoles from the ski shop at the resort, and they still did not do anything to help.

I've also heard amount having my boot liner heat molded which I will look into, but looking around on the internet heat molding your boot liner isn't the one stop shop to immediate comfort.

The culprits:

My boots are ""thirtytwo STW Boa Snowboard Boots"". I am a size 9.5-10 and the boots are 9.5. My toes barely touch the tip of the boots.

My board is called the ""rossignol nomad"" and I think its from the 90's. I got it off of craigslist for about 90 bucks. Turns out it wasn't the best board for a beginner because its a freeride board and is super directional. The board is also pretty heavy but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with my foot pain.

The bindings are just some shitty ones that came with the board but work.

3465,"Ah yes,  ad-hominem. An argument tactic that always speaks to the strength of one's argument. /s Just makes you look like an asshole tbh

You just posted an article that is using over 100 year old data. Forgive me, but that's not strong evidence. I'm talking like RCT's n shit, peer-reviewed journal articles n shit. I took it upon myself to find what you may be talking about. I found the article that is using the language you describe [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/?fbclid=IwAR0VXF8NdjsNnNzBAmYVjPN_Pt8xROn1wN89ILPYqHPu0Txr6hqzZ631yXs)

And yes, as expected, when compared to medical grade masks and respirators, your chance for infection when using a cloth mask is indeed higher. This was also done with frontline medical workers, so a pretty niche area to get your data from. 

I think you're operating on the idea that masks are supposed to only protect the person wearing them. The main idea behind them is to protect those around you. The same idea that lends me to believe that if you and I were hanging out and you pissed yourself, my chances of getting pissed on are quite a bit higher if you aren't wearing pants. Don't believe me? [Here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800) is a study speaking to what I mean. Too heady? Fair enough, that was a difficult read. [Here](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818) is a study that uses publicly available data to determine that **there is evidence that masks, AS YOU AND I WEAR THEM, are beneficial**

So yeah, you're little bolded part that you are so confident on is patently false. And this is based on data and studies done within the last 5 or so years, not 100+ year old data.

And since you were a bit of a dick in your last comment, I'll reciprocate a bit: sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up with your willfully obtuse bullshit. Putting a piece of cloth over your mouth of fucking course lowers transmission rates, just like it would lower the amount of spittle that gets airborn when you spew this bullshit out your mouth. Not only is it common sense, the science supports it. I just provided multiple high level studies to support this. You posted something that is nowhere near the level of studies I shared.

Lol at your Google searching for information against masks - that's like asking Satan for prayer recommendations. Try DDG or startpage. 

https://update.lib.berkeley.edu/2020/05/23/did-masks-work-the-1918-flu-pandemic-and-the-meaning-of-layered-interventions/

Yes, theoretically, as I've already stated, reusable masks can work. BUT, *in practice,* they're not beneficial because literally nobody uses them properly. 

Good to see that you now know what the burden of proof is tho ... after your ""multiple high-level sources"" proof to begin with lmfao. 

Maybe this time you could address my original point tho?? 🤔 Read it a few times to help it sink in: **there is no evidence that masks, as you and I wear them, are beneficial.**

FYI, this is the part of the discussion where normally you would go and find a source supporting your claim; that masks, as we wear them, work.

It honestly sounds like you're just making baseless claims, especially about seatbelts. Believe me, I started my career in the medical field as an EMT. Seatbelts have many downsides, but they are all outweighed by the benefits, usually. 

Even though the burden of proof is on you, I was curious and did a quick google search. Literally typed in ""bacterial pneumonia cotton masks reusing"" and the first like 5 results all shoot it down as a myth. I don't care to do further research on something that I'm fairly confident is bullshit, but as you made the claim and made it seem so universally accepted and known, perhaps you can show me some links.

I'll be honest, it seems like you don't really know what you're talking about  because I say I've worked in the medical field and you immediately assume I'm an MD. Now as for some real medical field experience for you: before all of this started, hospital workers at all the hospitals in my region, including frontline medical providers, had the choice of either getting the flu vaccine or wearing a mask all day while at work. Many people chose to wear their masks and they wore their mask all day long. Now its possible that they could be ""criminally liable under the law"" but it's funny, I haven't heard of any sort of class action lawsuit regarding that... and I live in a mad litigious area.

Divide the lessons practice into 3 days. 

Day 1. Learn going down on your toes all day.

Day 2. Learn going down on your heels all day.

Day 3. Link your turns.

For day 1 &amp; 2 I'll suggest to do it in a blue run, it forces you to make those turns fast and gain more control, if done in a green, you might encounter a flat spot and those are not fun for noobs.

For day 3, linking turns should be in the green runs. By the third day you will know if are goofy or regular.

For the last few days I found YouTube videos teaching what techniques to try first before heading down the hill. When I arrived at the hill I spent about 30-40 mins feeling what each edge felt like against the hill and eventually fully committed to riding and falling. Sure enough after an hour I felt confident enough to try a green run. By the end of the day I was riding down the green run without any bails. 

All said and done I’m completely hooked! Stopped at a snowboard shop after getting down from the hill just to ask questions in person about what kind of board would be right for me.

I will probably rent for the next few times but does anyone have any advice for someone who typically throws a lot of money at new hobbies?

3843,"Yo! So yeah, I think those would both be solid options for boots. It's really hard to say if you can't try them on, but they are fairly low profile. If possible, I would measure the centimeter size of both your feet and buy your boots based on that. I know Salomon fits pretty true to centimeter size, I'm not sure exactly how Burton fits, but that size will probably end up being about a half to a full size down from your street shoe, at least in Salomon. It's possible it could be more, I've seen people with really big street shoe sizes go way down in snowboard boots before. Ideally buy boots from somewhere where you can return them if you haven't worn them on the mountain, and ideally ideally go into a shop, a lot are still open.

For bindings, essentially what you're paying for up into that mid $200 range is durability, and beyond that they get stiffer as they get more expensive (this is a super generalization but holds somewhat true). I'd say if you can swing it, it's worth getting a slightly higher end binding just so nothing breaks on you. I like Rome because their warranty is super good, although looking at their size chart it's possible they wouldn't fit boots as big as yours. But yeah I wouldn't stress too much about the flex rating or anything unless it's talking about being ultra soft or super super stiff, pretty much all the medium range or all around bindings will work fine.

3863,"Hey all! I was storing all my gear over the winter and when I went to pick it up for this season it appears to have been misplaced, so I'm kinda starting over. My board was there at the very least. I've been riding a 2014 K2 Raygun 164W that I actually bought off someone here on [r/snowboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/) a few years back!

I'm 6'5"", 220ish lbs, size 14 foot. I do mostly all mountain, downhill type riding, don't usually hit the park or anything seriously so don't care too much about that. My previous bindings were used Burton freestyles, and my old boots were literally bought off of the rental shop at the end of the season maybe 6 or 7 years ago. So not a huge loss which is why I'm not too upset about having to get some new gear.

Because I have big feet I tend to have issues with my toes hanging over the edge of the board and catching the snow, even despite having the wide board. So anything to mitigate those problems would be helpful. I'm hoping to not spend more than like $500 on the whole setup, cuz I still have to buy a new helmet, goggles, and snowpants as well.

As far as boots, the [last time I asked this question here](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/2izybi/boots_for_big_feet_size_14_or_15/) (6 years ago), I got recommended Salomon and Burton boots, as they both brands boots are relatively low profile. I was just looking at the Salomon Dialogues and Burton Rulers, both seem decent. Are these still respectable choices for boots for large feet? Obviously this year I don't really have the opportunity to try on boots in person unfortunately, but I know that anything will be better than what I had previously.

For bindings, [the last time I asked this](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/2o44o7/i_just_bought_a_k2_raygun_164_wide_and_im_looking/) (also 6 years ago) I got recommended Burton custom bindings for their adjustability. I've seen a lot of recommendations for Union Forces and Rome 390 bindings in posts from the past couple years though, but both of these are a bit more pricey than the Burton customs. I've been riding for quite awhile, but I'd still say I'm at an intermediate level. All three of those bindings also have different flex ratings. My old bindings were burton freestyles, which I think generally have a soft flex, but it seems like medium flex might suit me better being tall and for all mountain riding. So maybe the 390s would be the ones to go with? Any other suggestions?

Long post, but would appreciate any help here. So much terminology and marketing mumbo jumbo involved in the listings for all these bindings, and I never know if sites are just trying to sell me things or if their ""buying guides"" are actually accurate in any way, ha.

3954,"I think it's gonna be a broken record but in case different wording helps you dial in the carves; You're opening up your shoulders to initiate the carve, that makes throwing your tail with that stored torsion more comfortable than a smooth carve from edge to edge. You want to keep your shoulders in line with the board, engage your heel or toe edge, then to transfer get comfortable bending your knees and keeping posture like a squat.

4138,"Whats up! I have a gear question/rant for you.

I just got my first snowboard after only riding rental equipment for about 25 days total the last 10 years. I had been checking out the Salomon Assassin online and happened to find a demo ex at the resort shop for half price so I just grabbed it and went to the hill. After a while I was starting to have second thoughts, and looking at charts online it seems that the board probably is too long for me. 

I am about 5'9 and 165 lbs and the board is 159 cm. Compairing it to the rental board I had (Nitro Cinema 161) it felt really light and responsive but still super stable att higher speeds. I even managed my first steep hill riding switch on it. I mainly go cruising down groomers with a bunch of skiers and like to see how fast I can go with nice big carves and for that type of riding, the board being a little too long seems like no problem at all. 

The question I have for you guys is: will having a really long board be bad for my progression?

I am 27 years old and will be trying learn (in the following order):

1. Higher ollies
2. Better switch riding
3. A bit of presses and butters
4. Maybe a few jumps and boxes

Super thankful for any answers! Maybe I'll also post this in r/snowboardingnoobs

So if the snow is sticking and freezing to the bottom of the board while you're out there, the rub-on will work wonders.  But you probably don't want to do that every run.  There's also machine wax, which is where you take it to a shop and they run your board over a fast waxing machine.  This will usually work for about a day maybe two and costs about $5-$10.

Austria is open for anyone who lives there, or traveled in and completed a 10 day quarantine. 

In France the lifts aren't working except for local school kids who have skiing as PE class and professional athletes with a competition license. However, touring is allowed so it's currently, as the French say, ""la folie furieuse"" with many inexperienced people buying touring kit to just skin up their familiar resort. The thing is that most of the resorts only have one or two slopes prepared for the slalom athletes and school kids to train and the rest isn't secured, avy work on the lowdown. There have been some harrowing videos from the past week or so... Some French resorts have since declared their resort forbidden for skiing when it's not secured, others have gone and done some avy work and secured a way up and some slopes to get down, completely for free just to prevent too much jerries from becoming a statistic.

4233,"I’ll politely say that what you heard is not correct. you shouldn’t grossly exaggerate the ollie but you should absolutely pop off of any and every lip whether it’s a jump, to a rail etc etc. you are at the stage of learning the basics of riding park so now is definitely the time when you want to establish good habits. it may not be distinctly visible when you watch advanced riders jump but yes everyone is absolutely popping off of the lip of a jump. When spinning or flipping its sometimes called “setting” because it’s an all in one motion that incorporates the body movement needed to start the rotation too.

The reason you want to pop off of the lip of a jump is that it puts you in control in the air. What I mean by this is that if you passively go off of a jump, its going to send you in whatever flight path based on the shape of the takeoff of the jump and you won’t remain upright. By popping, your body dictates the flight path you will take and as you practice, this will allow you to not get “bucked” by takeoffs that are all slightly different shapes. There’s nothing worse than hitting a jump and having it send you way backseat and you’re just flailing in the air until you land on your ass or back on a hard landing. Remember, these jumps are made of snow and the takeoffs are all shaped differently from
one to the next. Further, each one will change slightly throughout the day as they get used and also as weather conditions change. It’s not a concrete skatepark where everything is cookie cutter. This might not seem like it matters on beginner jumps like this one, but remember, you’re learning the basics now. It definitely matters when sending 30-40-50 foot tables. Additionally, the motion of ollieing naturally brings you into a more compact body position in the air which will help you stay stable, and puts you in position to grab your board which further helps you maintain your composure while off the ground.

When landing, you want to extend your feet out to meet the ground as it comes up to you, which is where the term stomping the landing comes from. You really don’t need to stomp per say, but the point is that you are driving the ship, and you are not “passively experiencing” this jump.",1,i ll politely say that what you heard is not correct you shouldn t grossly exaggerate the ollie but you should absolutely pop off of any and every lip whether it s a jump to a rail etc etc you are at the stage of learning the basics of riding park so now is definitely the time when you want to establish good habits it may not be distinctly visible when you watch advanced riders jump but yes everyone is absolutely popping off of the lip of a jump when spinning or flipping its sometimes called setting because it s an all in one motion that incorporates the body movement needed to start the rotation too the reason you want to pop off of the lip of a jump is that it puts you in control in the air what i mean by this is that if you passively go off of a jump its going to send you in whatever flight path based on the shape of the takeoff of the jump and you won t remain upright by popping your body dictates the flight path you will take and as you practice this will allow you to not get bucked by takeoffs that are all slightly different shapes there s nothing worse than hitting a jump and having it send you way backseat and you re just flailing in the air until you land on your ass or back on a hard landing remember these jumps are made of snow and the takeoffs are all shaped differently from one to the next further each one will change slightly throughout the day as they get used and also as weather conditions change it s not a concrete skatepark where everything is cookie cutter this might not seem like it matters on beginner jumps like this one but remember you re learning the basics now it definitely matters when sending 30 40 50 foot tables additionally the motion of ollieing naturally brings you into a more compact body position in the air which will help you stay stable and puts you in position to grab your board which further helps you maintain your composure while off the ground when landing you want to extend your feet out to meet the ground as it comes up to you which is where the term stomping the landing comes from you really don t need to stomp per say but the point is that you are driving the ship and you are not passively experiencing this jump,politely say heard correct grossly exaggerate ollie absolutely pop lip jump rail stage learning basics park definitely time want establish good habits distinctly visible watch advanced riders jump yes absolutely popping lip jump spinning flipping called setting motion incorporates body movement needed start rotation reason want pop lip jump puts control air mean passively jump going send flight path based shape takeoff jump remain upright popping body dictates flight path practice allow bucked takeoffs slightly different shapes worse hitting jump send way backseat flailing air land ass hard landing remember jumps snow takeoffs shaped differently change slightly day used weather conditions change concrete skatepark cookie cutter like matters beginner jumps like remember learning basics definitely matters sending 30 40 50 foot tables additionally motion ollieing naturally brings compact body position air help stay stable puts position grab helps maintain composure ground landing want extend feet meet ground comes term stomping landing comes really need stomp say point driving ship passively experiencing jump,polit say heard correct grossli exagger olli absolut pop lip jump rail stage learn basic park definit time want establish good habit distinctli visibl watch advanc rider jump ye absolut pop lip jump spin flip call set motion incorpor bodi movement need start rotat reason want pop lip jump put control air mean passiv jump go send flight path base shape takeoff jump remain upright pop bodi dictat flight path practic allow buck takeoff slightli differ shape wors hit jump send way backseat flail air land ass hard land rememb jump snow takeoff shape differ chang slightli day use weather condit chang concret skatepark cooki cutter like matter beginn jump like rememb learn basic definit matter send 30 40 50 foot tabl addit motion olli natur bring compact bodi posit air help stay stabl put posit grab help maintain composur ground land want extend feet meet ground come term stomp land come realli need stomp say point drive ship passiv experienc jump,0.028,0.841,0.131,0.9022,0

4245,"u/Vaugith is right. To add a little more info here just for your knowledge of your own equipment, what an asymmetrical true twin means is that there’s no designated nose or tail. The board is symmetrical tip to tip, but it’s not symmetrical lengthwise. The designated heelside edge will have a deeper side cut radius than the toeside wage. The reason for this is that the human body is not symmetrical front to back and so our body mechanics that we employ to turn toeside and heel side are not equal. By nature, we snowboarders have more leverage and ability to hold pressure on our edge on our toeside turns, and so the deeper side cut on our heel side edge is intended to compensate for that.

4633,"There is something I've heard called base burn that I don't see talked about too much but I have experienced it first hand. It's possible to damage your sintered base in a way that closes up the pores in the ptex and prevents it from absorbing as much wax in the future. I did it to a board when I first started hand waxing, i think from moving the iron too slow and having it too hot. The results were areas on the board mostly around the edges that after only one or two days riding would be that white milky chalky color that are a sure sign the base is dried out and needs a wax. I've heard that you can also do this to your board after not waxing for long periods, but I haven't seen that firsthand. The fix is pretty easy though: just take the board and bring it to a ski shop that will do a base grind and restructure and it should expose a new layer of ptex and clear right up.

Long story short: I suggest just paying attention to the color of your base and getting some wax on there before it starts to turn that whiteish color. Drying out once or twice probably isn't the end of the world. If you have to use some rub on wax it's better than nothing man. But if you really don't care about speed and it's not messing with your riding then I don't see what the difference is.",1,there is something i ve heard called base burn that i don t see talked about too much but i have experienced it first hand it s possible to damage your sintered base in a way that closes up the pores in the ptex and prevents it from absorbing as much wax in the future i did it to a board when i first started hand waxing i think from moving the iron too slow and having it too hot the results were areas on the board mostly around the edges that after only one or two days riding would be that white milky chalky color that are a sure sign the base is dried out and needs a wax i ve heard that you can also do this to your board after not waxing for long periods but i haven t seen that firsthand the fix is pretty easy though just take the board and bring it to a ski shop that will do a base grind and restructure and it should expose a new layer of ptex and clear right up long story short i suggest just paying attention to the color of your base and getting some wax on there before it starts to turn that whiteish color drying out once or twice probably isn t the end of the world if you have to use some rub on wax it s better than nothing man but if you really don t care about speed and it s not messing with your riding then i don t see what the difference is,heard called base burn talked experienced hand possible damage sintered base way closes pores ptex prevents absorbing wax future started hand waxing think moving iron slow hot results areas edges days white milky chalky color sure sign base dried needs wax heard waxing long periods seen firsthand fix pretty easy bring shop base grind restructure expose new layer ptex clear right long story short suggest paying attention color base getting wax starts turn whiteish color drying twice probably end world use rub wax better man really care speed messing difference,heard call base burn talk experienc hand possibl damag sinter base way close pore ptex prevent absorb wax futur start hand wax think move iron slow hot result area edg day white milki chalki color sure sign base dri need wax heard wax long period seen firsthand fix pretti easi bring shop base grind restructur expos new layer ptex clear right long stori short suggest pay attent color base get wax start turn whiteish color dri twice probabl end world use rub wax better man realli care speed mess differ,0.038,0.783,0.179,0.9274,0

4742,"Hi guys,   
I recently purchased the Yes Hello, and the sales person at the store picked out 149cm for me which goes up to my chin. Looks like a great size. But when I looked at the size chart, I am out of the recommended weight. The sales person said, the weight is just a recommendation, and that it's easier to ride a shorter board anyways. The next size up is 152cm, and while I'm still out of the recommended weight, I'm closer to it. Most youtube videos or board buying guides talk about the importance of getting a board for your weight. 

I've taken the board up once, and it feels great to be honest. I don't feel like the board is harder to control or unstable. The store I bought it from offers a 30 day satisfaction so I could go back and get the bigger size....What do you think? Keep the 149 or get the 152? Would the extra 3cm make a difference?

1. Never fall backwards, if possible. Just a nasty way to knock yourself out. If you start going backwards uncontrollably, lean upwards toward the peak and fall on your stomach and forearms, DONT BRACE ON YOUR WRISTS. 

2. I’m guessing you mean you “leafed” down the hill. Mostly perpendicular to the run, while going left and right. No big deal, we all started here. Your shoulders will lead your direction, so if you twist around, so will the board. 

3.  Before you get up, roll onto your knees. Bend, and stand up. Extend your dominant hand out and leave your weak hand grabbing your pant near the knee. This will help you align your board and shoulders.

4764,"Best way I would figure would be to go down the slope in a sidewinder fashion and switch which side of your board is facing down hill at each turn.

So you start out horizontal right, at the top right of the run. Then you go to the left until you reach the side, slow down and turn your whole body at the turn so that your back is now facing down hill. Now you go to the other side, again using your left foot forward but this time your back is facing down the hill. Once you get to the side again, slow down, turn around so that your front is facing down hill, and repeat.

Not sure if I am making sense but generally you learn to go down the hill horizontally but you progressively angle more and more forward until you can go down the hill forward. When you are going down horizontally though, you are only training yourself to control the board when your body and head are facing down mountain.

That'd be pretty cool, but nearly impossible to put together. First, you'd need about 20 boards to cover a decent spread of the mainstream brands. And that's just for a single board category (e.g. all-mtn freestyle). Probably a bunch of bindings of the same model, too, since you don't want to remove and re-mount bindings 20 times in a day. Then, because you can't really snowboard with a blindfold on, you'd need to cover the boards' graphics. And finally you'd have to test them in a variety of terrains, all in the same day/similar conditions.

The logistics of writing that is already giving me a headache xD",1,gt what i would really like to see is a blind testing of snowboards that d be pretty cool but nearly impossible to put together first you d need about 20 boards to cover a decent spread of the mainstream brands and that s just for a single board category e g all mtn freestyle probably a bunch of bindings of the same model too since you don t want to remove and re mount bindings 20 times in a day then because you can t really snowboard with a blindfold on you d need to cover the boards graphics and finally you d have to test them in a variety of terrains all in the same day similar conditions the logistics of writing that is already giving me a headache xd,gt really like blind testing pretty cool nearly impossible need 20 cover decent spread mainstream brands single category mtn freestyle probably bunch bindings model want remove mount bindings 20 times day really blindfold need cover graphics finally test variety terrains day similar conditions logistics writing giving headache xd,gt realli like blind test pretti cool nearli imposs need 20 cover decent spread mainstream brand singl categori mtn freestyl probabl bunch bind model want remov mount bind 20 time day realli blindfold need cover graphic final test varieti terrain day similar condit logist write give headach xd,0.048,0.741,0.212,0.8074,0

4949,"Adding on to the “support your local shop” bit: You could crack out on brands and tech on the internet, but you’ll probably find yourself overthinking things and second guessing yourself by the time you’re adding stuff to your cart.
