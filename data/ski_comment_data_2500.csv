5," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

51," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

74," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

120," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

143," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

189," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

212," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

258," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

281," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

327," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

350," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

396," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

419," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

465," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

488," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

534," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

557," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

603," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

626," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

672," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

695," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

741," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

764," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

810," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

833," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

879," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

902," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

948," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

971," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1017," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1040," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1086," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1109," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1155," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1178," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1224," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1247," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1293," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1316," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1362," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1385," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1431," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1454," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1500," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1523," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1569," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1592," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1638," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1661," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1707," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1730," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1776," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1799," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1845," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1868," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1914," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

1937," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

1983," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2006," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

2052," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2075," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

2121," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2144," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

2190," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2213," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

2259," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2282," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

2328," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2351," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

2397," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2420," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

2466," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?

2489," Need Help/Advice for short, wide, tall FEMALE boots!

Female. Foot is 23.5cm long, 107mm wide, with an instep of 26.5mm, giant calves, skinny ankles, and bulging angle bones.

\*For those who don't know about instep, 23.5mm is considered ""normal"" and 24.5mm is considered ""tall"". My feet are a further 2cm about ""tall"". I have to remove all insoles from a ski boot just to try them on because my foot won't even get inside them due to height.

I love skiing, or rather used to love skiing. I lived in CO for two seasons and each season bought a different boot from experienced boot fitters. We spent the entire season adjusting the boots, as in heat molded multiple times, grinding, literally cutting holes in the top, custom insoles, basically everything that could be done to a boot. The second boots were the Solomon's with custom heat molded shells - but those still could not expand enough for my weird shaped foot. Skiing has hurt every single day from hour 1 to hour 8. Doesn't matter if the boots are ""fresh"" that day or ""warmed up"" that day, it was constant pain. I ended up with permanent nerve damage on the top of my foot.

I've moved back East and and am planning on skiing around 10 days a year. I don't ski hard and would definitely compromise performance for comfort, mostly because I can't have any kind of performance if I don't even ski. I've tried to research everything on the internet, but most answer I can find are for men's boots which are shaped differently (primarily around the calf) and also aren't manufactured short enough (23.5mm).

My fiance loves to ski and I want to give it one more try for him. Does anyone have female ski boot advice for super wide feet, wide calf, tall instep?

Any experience with the APEX?
